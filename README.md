# Clave Operating System Source Tree

Clave is an open source operating system that focuses on security and compatibility. Currently supported Archtictures are only `x86`, but it will be expanded later. The goal of the project is to create a fully usable operating system that has no limitations. Everyone should be able do to what ever he want, no matter which Architecture and Setup the User has.

## Supported Hardware

**General**: `none` \
**Graphics**: `VGA 80x25` \
**Input**: `none` \
**Storage**: `none`

## Building

For building Clave you need to have Docker and Qemu installed on your system, read the Documentation at [`docs/building`](docs/building.md). Otherwise you need to have a Toolchain installed with following Progams: `GCC Cross-Compiler, Binutils, NASM, GNU Make, GNU Coreutils, Git`.
